**This is my fourth and final project for GA's Software Engineering Immersive course.** 

**I built a full-stack application** with a Python Django REST framework API and a React front end with Tailwind styling. 
It's called The Community Project, and the idea was to make a template for a potential community website that I might build for friends or future clients looking to build an online community. 

*Here's a quick look at The Community Project homepage:*
